## **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

**Project:** Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform – Project & Task Management System

---

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the functional and non-functional requirements of the Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform. The system allows multiple organizations (tenants) to independently manage users, projects, and tasks with complete data isolation, role-based access control, and subscription-based limits.

The platform is designed to be scalable, secure, and production-ready, following modern SaaS architecture principles.
